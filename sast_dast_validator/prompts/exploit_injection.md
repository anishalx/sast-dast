# Injection Test

Navigate to: {url}

Look for {vuln_type} evidence:
- SQL errors (table/query info exposed)
- Response delay (time-based)
- Command output in page
- Math result "49" for SSTI (7*7)

If no evidence after the first quick check, return NOT_VULNERABLE to avoid extra steps.

**Result format** (use done action):
- `done("VULNERABLE: [evidence]")` - if injection worked
- `done("NOT_VULNERABLE: input sanitized")` - if safe
- `done("BLOCKED: [reason]")` - if error/blocked
