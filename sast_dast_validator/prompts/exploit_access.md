# Access Control Test

Navigate to: {url}

Check for access control issues:
- Can you access another user's data?
- Is admin functionality accessible?
- Does the page require authentication?

**Result format** (use done action):
- `done("VULNERABLE: [what was accessed]")` - if unauthorized access worked
- `done("NOT_VULNERABLE: access denied 401/403")` - if properly protected
- `done("BLOCKED: [reason]")` - if error
