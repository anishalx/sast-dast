# Security Test

Issue reported: {message}

Check for vulnerability evidence:
- Unexpected behavior from payload
- Sensitive data exposed
- Security controls bypassed

If no clear evidence after one quick check, stop and return NOT_VULNERABLE to avoid extra steps.

**Result format** (use done action):
- `done("VULNERABLE: [evidence]")` - if exploitable
- `done("NOT_VULNERABLE: [reason]")` - if safe
- `done("BLOCKED: [reason]")` - if error
