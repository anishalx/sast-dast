# Open Redirect Test

Navigate to: {url}

Check for redirect behavior:
- Did browser go to external domain?
- Check final URL after redirect
- Look for evil.example.com in URL

**Result format** (use done action):
- `done("VULNERABLE: redirected to [final URL]")` - if external redirect worked
- `done("NOT_VULNERABLE: redirect blocked")` - if stayed on same domain
- `done("BLOCKED: [reason]")` - if error
