# XSS Test

Navigate to: {url}

Look for XSS evidence:
- Alert dialog with "{marker}"  
- Unescaped script/img/svg tags in page source
- JavaScript execution in console

If no evidence appears after the first quick check, return NOT_VULNERABLE to avoid extra steps.

**Result format** (use done action):
- `done("VULNERABLE: [evidence]")` - if XSS executed
- `done("NOT_VULNERABLE: payload sanitized")` - if encoded/stripped
- `done("BLOCKED: [reason]")` - if page error/403
- Document exact evidence if vulnerability confirmed
- Note any WAF or security mechanisms observed
